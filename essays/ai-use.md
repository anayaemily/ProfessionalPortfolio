## Reflecting on My use of AI in ICS314

### I. Introduction

The recent introduction of public use of artificial intelligence has shaped education and revolutionized the way education is seen, both for learners and teachers. On one hand, widely accessible AI tools revolutionized education, allowing for fast iteration, knowledge summarizing and creative ideation in learning. However, the misuse of AI in education is extremely prevalent, with cheating and AI detection algorithms plaguing what once was a mostly trust based learning system. Within this course, I used chatGPT and github copilot to try and enhance my learning, and as a fallback teacher for the course content, as all of the content we learned was on our own from the modules. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
Within this course, we had a plethora of learning experiences, with over 70 assignments listed in laulima, and even more practice WODs and experiences not listed, there was a massive amount of content and work to be learned and then done in the course, and using AI helped with the management of this course load. For each of the different sections I had a different usage of AI, or lack thereof to support learning.

#### Experience WODs e.g. E18
In the Experience WODs on the course website, for example E18; Functional Programming, where we dived into hawaii open dataset, I wasn’t able to use copilot, as we were working in typescript playground at the time. Within these experiences generally, I tried to stay away from using AI unless I had issues with the code, and then I would use it to help me learn the correct way to go about solving an issue, in this case for E18, I used chatGPT to help me debug, and check my assumptions. I thought my code wasn’t computing the data correctly, however, upon re entering the dataset, the checks that GPT suggested made me realise I was calculating the total awards, instead of just the total degrees, which is why my original output was incorrect. Using chatGPT to help you understand what the assignment is truly asking, helped me to write the correct code. 

#### In-class Practice WODs
During the In-class practice WOD’s, I stayed away from using any form of AI to help me out, because in those times which the pass/fail didn’t matter, I wanted to get a true representation of my knowledge at the time, instead of cheating my way out of a learning experience. 

#### In-class WODs
However, for the in-class WOD’s, I did use copilot a few times, and chatGPT to help me debug some issues I would get, as time is of the essence, and if my own problem solving avenues didn’t work, I reached out for help, however I never got AI to write the code for me, or write my entire code like I imagine you could, because then you learn nothing. For example, during the in-class WOD dollar tree where we were working with a database, I was having an issue where I wasn’t able to login to the system, and no matter what I tried, I wasn’t able to connect to the database, which is when I asked chatGPT and copilot to help, and I was able to get troubleshooting advice, and reset the database and was able to complete the WOD. 

#### Essays
For the essays, I always while writing, put the prompt into chatGPT for ideas on how to format my essays, to get inspiration to write, just like artists often draw an object, or a sketch from the internet to warm their brain into painting, I can read more in depth explanations to understand what is needed from me, and then I go and write my own essay with my interpretation of the essay prompt, and my experiences, since a lot of these essays were based on experiences within the class. For example, with the last essay on design patterns, I was really struggling to come up with an analogy to compare to, so I used chatGPT to generate a set of 20 different analogies I could use, and then I was able to write the essay after having an analogy, an essay plan, and then analysing the patterns in my work. 

#### Final project
For the final project, I used github copilot religiously. Having the ability to press tab, and the lines of mundane code and setup write themselves was incredible. It allowed me to make the ids for recipe grids and other repetitive items go so much faster, so I could focus on writing code for styling and functionality. I also used it for debugging, and issue tracking, if my code didn’t work, and I had the same issues going on consistently, I already have them solved in the backlog which I can refer back to and fix them with ease. I was also having issues with the styling overlaps within my landing image component, as every time I would merge to main the styling would revert back to when it was broken, so I used copilot to help me identify and fix this conflict. 

#### Learning a concept / tutorial
Within the context of learning concepts and tutorials, I found most of the content was present on the modules and external sites. I only used AI to summarise some modules and important pieces of content to refer back to throughout the week, and throughout the module of learning. I also found it really helpful when something in the modules was confusing or not assimilating into my head, to have it explained in a different way. 

#### Answering a question in class or in Discord  + Asking or answering a smart-question
I did not use AI to help me ask or answer questions in discord, likewise with asking or answering a smart question within these servers, as I did not have the need to ask many tough questions, nor did I need clarity and understanding of other students' questions. 

#### Coding example 
I used AI to explain coding examples within our modules some of the time. When we first got taught the concept of reducing, I used AI to explain that to me like I was 5, and give me examples of why it is an extremely powerful tool to use. I found this method useful to bridge that gap of understanding, and not just resorting back to things I already knew, like loops. 

#### Explaining code
I didn’t really use AI much for explaining code, as the majority of the coding examples we were given were in youtube video format with explanations, so I had no need to have the code itself explained to me. 

#### Writing code
I used AI to aid code, never just write it for me, as I feel as though, along with cheating, I am only robbing myself of a learning opportunity, and the whole point any of us are here is to learn, and to gain skill, but skill is not gained through copying and pasting things from AI models you don’t understand. This way you are also totally unable to debug, change vital functionality or make many edits, as you don’t have an understanding of what the code does. 

#### Documenting code
I really enjoyed copilot in my projects also for the use of documentation, and this was especially helpful within the final project, where so much code was written by different people for the same project, and we all needed to have understanding of what the others were doing, and how to best describe our own code, to build off of and also navigate, especially in massive styling files like our globals.css, which handles the main layouts and styling for the app. This documentation for the styling also helped me to identify double ups in styling components that were conflicting with each other, and I was able to fix these issues.

#### Quality assurance
AI tools like chatGPT and copilot are incredible at quality assurance and debugging, I used this many times throughout this entire course, and I use AI to help with this in other personal projects as well. Having a personal assistant built into your keyboard that helps to debug and fix your issues, especially mundane ones like ESLint new line errors, is an immensely useful tool in any development environment. 

#### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
Beyond this list, I did not have any other uses for AI that I haven’t already talked about within the assignments, as I found that I didn’t have a need to experiment with other learning models or applications since I was learning everything I needed to from my basic applications of AI, and the course content.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

I believe that AI significantly enhanced my learning experience within this class, allowing for full understanding of concepts, and aiding me on my own learning journey, so I could learn everything myself, practice the skills, comprehend and understand the concepts and applications of those concepts, and then use AI as a tool to help the development of my own code, and the debugging. I feel my learning in this course has been exponential, it is the most workload intensive computer science course yet, and the learning benefits from that have been extremely evident. 

### IV. Practical Applications:
In one of my projects presented in my portfolio, I fine tuned an AI model to serve as a google scholar critic, making your research easier, which I use to this day in papers I have to write, and topics I am researching. AI can be manipulated and applied to pretty much any discipline across the planet, from using AI voice models to cold call for businesses, boosting their sales, to study helpers, to real-time video editing using tools like Insta360. This massively wide application, and the lack of a ceiling right now as we are in a time of exponential growth as the AI industry continues to develop, allows for many helpful tools to be built. AI is only getting smarter, and will continue to solve engineering problems, and real world problems if it gets applied correctly, and in a just way. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Within this course, I haven’t encountered issues with the use of AI, whether that is the AI not having contextual understanding, or chatGPT not being able to debug, because I never had issues that were really critical, it was more just local browser side errors, or mistakes I had made during writing the code for all the page components. Even taking into account my most stressful use of AI debugging during the in-class WOD, the AI was able to understand and help me overcome the challenges I was having. I wasn’t relying on AI to write code for me, or debug things that were extremely difficult, and I was relying on my own learning and understanding instead. The opportunities for further integration of AI in engineering are so vast, as AI gets better, you could have an inbuilt teacher, watching and providing feedback on every WOD attempt so you are able to practice and get really good at the coding challenges. It is such a valuable learning resource, and can simulate real-world problems for us to practice, and as students, this learning experience is invaluable to our careers as developers. Also, the use of AI is extremely beneficial and integrated into professional workplaces, for project management, debugging, and using tools like cursor. If this is integrated into our learning, then we are able to prepare for the situations we would be in during professional teams and pursuits. 

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
Provide a comparative analysis between traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education. Consider aspects like engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development.
There is a stark difference between traditional teaching methods, and curriculums, and what AI could bring to the table. The traditional methods such as lectures, tutorials, WODs and tests, all emphasise learning at a foundational level, historically requiring us as students to have a massive knowledge base of the code we are using, and the languages we are writing in. 
AI enhanced approaches to teaching and learning also have some major benefits, when used right. I can drop entire study guides, tutorials and course material into chatGPT and other AI applications similar, and receive personalised study guides and feedback on assignments, optimising everything to my own personal learning journey. When you encounter any problems, whether in understanding or functionality of code, AI is a teacher inside of your computer, accessible 24/7 with miniscule response times, which is something that traditional professors can’t afford students, especially in larger, more self directed courses like this one. 
I think there is a place for both in the education system, AI is a powerful tool when used correctly, but if you rely on it too much, there is a fine line between becoming a software engineer, or getting a degree in chatGPT proficiency. You need to be able to understand and write the code yourself to be able to prompt the AI to do what you need, and to debug and understand the answers given to you. I believe that when learning, you need to build a foundational understanding of concepts, and then you can use tools later on. For example, Picasso started as a classical portrait artist, and was immensely talented at photorealism, and then developed his own style, after gaining all of the skills to craft anything he could ever envision beforehand. 

### VII. Future Considerations:

As I have stated in the previous section, AI has many incredible applications, and hold immense potential within educational sectors, and will continue to further the field for years to come. AI can offer explanations and personalised teaching for complex concepts, and act as a 24/7 tutor for students.
Obviously, this is not the only way AI is used, and humans will always find a way to cheat the system, or find a way to use these tools in ways they weren’t intended, so there needs to be a system to prevent and minimise misuse of the tools, to give people the education they need to become the developers they want to be. These challenges will be ever present, and will need to have guidelines, ways to test the knowledge of the person without AI to help, and thorough academic integrity measures. There also needs to be consideration and content surrounding the ethics of AI use, as the developers that come through these educational systems will one day be the developers shaping the future of AI as well.

### VIII. Conclusion:
Summarize your reflections and insights regarding the use of AI in the Software Engineering course. Conclude with any recommendations or suggestions for optimizing the integration of AI in future courses.
After reflecting on my use of AI within this course, and this course overall, I can say that AI tools have been an asset to enhance my learning experience this semester. They have helped me to understand software engineering concepts, work on my problem solving skills, and allowed me to work more efficiently, offering support and teaching moments throughout the work we have done. The value of these tools is in the way you use them, and I am glad I used them as an aid, rather than using them as a crutch. By taking the traditional course content, and working on my own understanding and learning, and then using AI as an extra tool, I feel as though I have gotten so much out of this semester, and learned skills that will be essential to my journey as a software engineer. As AI continues to become more prevalent, and integrated into our society as a whole, there needs to be a level of focus on the learning of the individual, and the foundational concepts in which students need to understand to be able to succeed. 
However, by embracing AI as it comes, and using it to its full potential to build on your knowledge and capabilities as a developer, it will allow for learning, development and future solutions that would never be possible without AI, improving our systems for the better.
