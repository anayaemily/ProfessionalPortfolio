*Typescript: Through the lens of self-teaching and academic assimilation*

Typescript, for me, was something I was thrown into during the first week of my first ever internship. I was tasked with the problem of making a full stack, functioning website with a design that looks good, within one week. My mentors wanted to see if I could not only survive, but work well in the environment I would exist in over the next four months of the internship. At the time, I had never used Typescript, I didn’t even know what React or Next.js were, and had barely any working knowledge of Javascript, so this was extremely daunting. Yet, I found a solution and then worked to design and implement react components for the next 4 months.

Because I was thrown into the deep end with learning Typescript, especially being self taught, so I ended up speeding through and over a lot of the content, to extract exactly what I needed to succeed in that situation. This meant I missed out on a lot of content I would have needed for a traditional university course environment. Also, because there was a specific way of doing things for the company, I only really got exposed to that. The benefit was that this startup was super AI friendly, like most coding environments are now, and I got set up to use copilot and ChatGPT/Claude for a lot of my problems and issues, and was encouraged to fix any and all bugs by myself, using these tools, before consulting my mentors. This prompted me to learn and to save time if it was an ‘intern level’ issue I was having, like forgetting a semicolon somewhere. By learning in a really fast paced environment such as this, and leaning heavily on the support of AI to code, I excelled in the conditions that I was given. This came at the expense of not having to  just burn the syntax of a language into my head, like you would in a course like scenario. 

Even though I was thrown in the deep end for my internship, learning a new language and making a full stack website within a week, WODs are a whole new challenge for me.  I personally thrive on pressure in other facets of life, such as playing volleyball for the New Zealand women's national team, and playing games in front of crowds with thousands of people, but it is still unnerving to transfer that skill to the fast-paced coding WODs in class.  They are a new test, because they are different from any kind of pressure environment I have experienced before, even compared to exams and other tests. I think the frequency of the WODs are scary to me, as they require you to be consistently improving your knowledge of the language, and be able to perform well each week. 
Despite this new pressure added to each class, I feel as though I will improve greatly, in both my fluency and quick-thinking skills while doing these WODs, and what better way to practice putting yourself under pressure than doing it repetitively and in front of an entire class of people! It will also be incredibly beneficial for future job interviews, especially as they get more technical when you move up the ranks, or go for more challenging, and rewarding jobs. Having a baseline confidence in your ability to solve problems, no matter when or how you are asked to, will make the process of job-searching so much less nerve-racking, so you are able to showcase who you really are as a candidate. 

Pressure makes diamonds, and that will certainly be the case for this semester of learning. I have been faced with pressure environments before within my sport, and during exams, but this athletic software engineering structure will push me to perform in a different discipline. I am excited to embrace the intensity, assimilate the languages, and learn course content in a more challenging way.
