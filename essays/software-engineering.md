### The Influence of Software Engineering Practices

Throughout the semester in this course, I have gained valuable insights into software engineering in a broad sense, even though the content was centered around web development. The course introduced key software engineering principles and practices that can be applied in many other disciplines within the field. Although we touched on many different topics throughout the learning modules, I found Agile Project Management, Configuration Management and Design Patterns the most valuable, as they apply across all types of software development. 

#### Embracing Flexibility

Agile Project Management is an iterative, flexible approach to software development that focuses and relies on continuous collaboration, feedback, and the gradual release and improvement of a project. Unlike traditional, linear processes, which have rigid requirements, and little change, Agile ensures you improve and change your process based on feedback and evaluation, allowing for more improvement in a system. Agile project management allows you to break down bigger projects into smaller iterations, or milestones, allowing for feedback and change to meet the delivery requirements. 
The main implementation of Agile Project management I got to learn and experience within this course was with IDPM (issue driven project management). IDPM enables teams to break larger projects down into manageable tasks that can be tracked, assigned, and completed incrementally using a management tool, which in our case was done through Github. Each issue listed represents a bug fix, new feature, workflow, or enhancement, that is worked on in separate branches, allowing for continuous improvement while maintaining security in the main branch. I really enjoyed the level of accountability that this provides, as team members must do the work they were assigned, which aligns with the overall project goals. 
Outside of just web development, I can see Agile and IDPM being applied to different disciplines, like game development, computer graphics, research projects, and other application development projects. The Agile principles, constant feedback and adaptability makes IDPM a really valuable tool that I want to continue implementing in my other classes and personal projects.

#### Maintaining Order in Chaos

Another software engineering principle that aligned extremely well with the accountability and iterative nature of Agile project management, was the consistency of configuration management. Configuration management in software engineering is the management process focusing on maintenance, consistency and control of a project in all manners, function, performance, design and much more. The management process enables us as developers to maintain integrity and traceability within a project, and manage the codebase appropriately for the best workflow. Github was a tool that played a crucial role in our configuration management during the final project, providing branch management, version controls, and other collaborative measures. 
Configuration management is extremely important for consistency and the safety of a project, having strict roles and requirements allows for iterative development while staying controlled and organized, especially with bigger teams working on and contributing to projects. Branching strategies and pull requests allow us to not disturb the main codebase, and work simultaneously, and reviews before merges help us to maintain code quality. 
Based on these consistencies and safety this management principle allows, it is evident that configuration management should and can be used in many other development environments, not just within web development.

#### Building with Purpose

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common or recurring problems in software development. They provide a blueprint for solving issues for projects that allow for maintenance, efficiency and scalability. Some well known design patterns are the singleton design pattern, factory design pattern and compound components. Singleton patterns ensure classes only have one instance, which is useful for the management of shared resources, and compound components are a react design pattern that manages component nesting. 
I have used design patterns within my projects this semester, namely the final project, to improve functionality, code readability, and in reusing components. For example, applying the factory design pattern in my own final web application allowed me to streamline object creation, by separating the creation of components from the code that uses them, ensuring both remain independently manageable.
Component based design patterns in React allow developers to separate the crafting of logic and aesthetic while developing fully functional applications. Each component serves an individual purpose and can be reused, fixed or updated without disrupting the components it interacts with. 
These design patterns, among others, allow for modular, reusable and scalable code, something that can be applied not only to web development. They are essential to maintain codebase functionality, readability and collaboration standardization.


During this class, I have learned that software development and engineering is more than just blindly writing code, and the practices and tools that you can adopt to enhance quality, scalability and maintenance control are immensely important to the success of your work. Agile Project Management, Configuration Management, and Design Patterns are just a few of the concepts we have touched on, which enriched my understanding and learning within the discipline. These principles donâ€™t only apply to web development, and have applications in many fields across the industry. As I move forward in my studies and career, these principles can guide me in tackling challenges, delivering solutions and contributing quality work, no matter the project.
