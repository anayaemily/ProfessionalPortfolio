#### The Power of Effective Communication

Effective communication is really important in software engineering and development. While there are no ‘stupid’ questions, there are bad ones in the way they are framed. It is natural to ask a clumsy or poorly researched question once in a while, but taking steps to frame questions being asked on a public forum in a more concise way, will lead to more helpful answers and valuable learning situations, rather than creating frustration or embarrassment for questions that seem to be lazy or a waste of time. 

In the world of computer science, sites like Stack Overflow have served as a great example of how the quality of questions has a direct correlation to the answers received, and the value of learning within the community. In Eric Raymond’s now somewhat iconic FAQ Blog, [How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) (Raymond & Moen, 2001), he outlines that good questions need to be approached with prior research, be well thought out, and framed clearly enough to engage and provide understanding to those helping. Smart questions, in essence, are defined by their ability to convey information, show prior effort, and communicate the problem with enough specificity in a concise and succinct manner. 
Smart questions are also really important to improve communication and learning within a community, because they frame the references for everyone else experiencing similar problems, which happens often. When you ask a smart question, you are not only contributing and getting direct feedback to aid with your own learning and development as a programmer, you are contributing to a larger conversation that can aid others in the future.   

#### Smart Questions in Action: A Case Study

A good example of a smart question posted by GManNickG (2012), on Stack Overflow is one that asks [Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array). This question isn’t a vague “ask for help”, and instead provides a detailed description of the problem faced, including relevant and specific code snippets. The poster explains their own initial hypothesis, their prior thinking, and why the code doesn’t conform to this, creating a complete picture of the issue, while also clearly outlining what troubleshooting they need from the community. As reflected in the upvotes for both this question and the extremely well formatted answers (see Stack Overflow, 2012), this thread highlights a really well framed question, with evidence that the original poster had already done their homework around troubleshooting the issue, put in the effort to test their initial assumptions, and provided their work surrounding this testing. The question is extremely valuable to the community, and is scored as one of the highest upvoted questions on Stack Overflow. The framing, and high quality answers that ensue provide continuous value to others who have this issue, and serve as a model resource for the community.

##### The Learning Opportunity

On the opposite end of the spectrum, not (as) smart questions can often lead to sub-par answers, or not contribute to the community at all. One example of this is the question [How might I replace a portion of a link's href attribute with a variable value?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944037/how-might-i-replace-a-portion-of-a-links-href-attribute-with-a-variable-value) (AnApprentice, 2009). While AnApprentice does provide relevant code snippets and a clear question, it is evident they have not done their research into the basics before asking for help. The question is the opposite of what the example I gave above does, it lacks basic effort, depth, and there is no evidence of exploration into other solutions before posting. Because of this, the question just highlights the original posters lack of effort, and is instead asking someone else to do basic thinking for them. 
Questions like these are seen as lazy to the community, this question by AnApprentice was such a striking example of this, that it was cited in a post about [How to handle stupid questions on Stack Overflow](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33606/about-stupid-questions-asked-on-stack-overflow) (Meta Stack Exchange, 2010). The post outlines that in these cases, it is more productive to the individual, and the community, to think twice about the problem before reaching out. This lack of effort from the poster is often reflected in the quality of answer that is provided, and just ends up just adding clutter to the platform, making good-quality content harder to find as it is dispersed amongst low-quality posts. 
Despite what I just outlined, I still believe that there are no stupid questions. There are only lazy people asking the questions. You can ask a bad question because it lacks effort and thought, but you end up missing out on the help you need, the learning that you could grasp on your own, and in contributing to an effective community environment.

The crucial takeaway is that asking smart questions requires effort, and the effort you put in impacts the quality of the responses you receive back. Effort means doing your homework about the issue, testing your own hypothesis and potential solutions, and framing your questions and method in a concise way that allows for further positive communication. It is much easier to ask a question without much thought, but taking the time to pose a smart question pays off in the long run of your own development, and in the development of the community, and resources available, as a whole.
